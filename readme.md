# HLS streaming

Stream a camera and its sliding window history via HLS, optimized for <10 seconds latency.

Change how much footage youd like to save. Change the size of video chunks used.

&nbsp;

## Dependencies

This code uses the following libraries:
- `ffmpeg`: for handling the live stream to video chunking HLS protocol
- `docker`: for serving the generated files and hosting the html viewer with nginx

&nbsp;

## Usage
1. Run your http live camera feed, and get its url
    If you need code to host a http live camera feed look [here](https://github.com/BrianLesko/http-camera-server-python)
2. replace the URL in start.sh with your live camera url
3. run the ffmpeg command in start.sh
4. run the nginx server with the commands in start_docker.sh
5. view the web stream at http://localhost:8080

&nbsp;

## About

HLS streaming was introduced by Apple and since its creation has been one of the most popular ways to stream video. It allows adaptive quality and low latency. The setup here is more cumbersome than a simple http live server, but allows viewing the history of the stream and allows the client to buffer content. Written by Brian Lesko for learning purposes. For other software projects related to robotics engineering, mechanical engineering, and software engineering see my other repositories.
